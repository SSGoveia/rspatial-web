# Introduction

These pages accompany the book "Geographic Information Analysis" by David O'Sullivan and David J. Unwin [(2nd Edition, 2010)](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470288574.html). 

This book is an excellent and very accessible introduction to spatial data analysis; but it does not show how to practially implement the approaches that are discussed. 

Many of the numerical examples in the text are implemented here, and some of the other techniques discussed are illustrated here as well. We hope that this is a useful contribution that allows readers of the book to get a more hands-on way to understand the material covered; and to apply such approaches in their own work. 

The examples are all implemented with *R*. If you are new to *R*, first go through this [introduction](http://rspatial.org/intr/).
