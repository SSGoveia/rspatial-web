# 1. The length of a coastline

```{r, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(knitr)
opts_chunk$set(
	fig.width = 4,
	fig.height = 5,
	fig.cap = '',
	collapse = TRUE
)
library(raster)
library(rgdal)
```

See http://rspatial.org/cases/rst/2-coastline.html to see how you can compute the fractal length of a coast line.
